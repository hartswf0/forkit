# FORK CASCADE: The Ethical Runtime

**Project:** Fork Cascade (Ethical IDE)
**Version:** 2.0.0
**Status:** High-Fidelity Prototype

## Overview
**Fork Cascade** is an experimental "Ethical Runtime Environment"—a suite of visualization tools and simulations designed to process, display, and interact with **"Thick Data"** (complex, context-rich ethical paradoxes).

Unlike traditional "AI Alignment" which seeks to flatten values into rules, Fork Cascade embraces the **irreducible complexity** of human moral reasoning. It creates a "gymnasium" for the conscience.

## Key Modules

### 1. `fork-cascade-viz.html` (The Ethical IDE)
The central dashboard. A sophisticated tree visualizer that parses the 48 Ethical Paradoxes.
-   **Features:**
    -   **Context Spectrogram:** Real-time waveform analysis of "Thick Data" text.
    -   **Ghost Mode:** Simulates future causal paths.
    -   **Moral Mixer:** Filters decision trees by "Protocol" vs "Risk".
    -   **Test Mode:** A "Choose Your Own Adventure" interface that tracks your "Moral Genome".

### 2. `HOLO-VIEWER.html` (Cinematic Loop)
A 3D "Cinematic Viewer" that plays the ethical dilemmas as immersive loops.
-   **Tech:** Three.js, CSS 3D Transforms.
-   **Function:** Visualizes the "Setting" and "Sensory" layers of the Thick Data.

### 3. `fork-lever.html` (Continuous Flow)
A high-speed, infinite runner where decisions must be made in real-time.
-   **Innovation:** "Lookahead Forecast" signs that warn of approaching consequences.
-   **Physics:** Seamless track switching based on A/B choices.

### 4. `dh0.html` (The Genome)
A 3D double-helix visualization of the user's accumulated moral decisions.

## The Data (`thick_data_merged.js`)
The beating heart of the system. A corpus of 48 distinct "Fork Paradoxes" (e.g., *Petrov's Five Minutes*, *The Trampoline*).
See [THICK_DATA_README.md](./THICK_DATA_README.md) for schema details.

## How to Run
1.  Open `fork-cascade-viz.html` in a modern browser.
2.  Click **TEST MODE** to begin a session.
3.  Make decisions to generate your **Practitioner Parts Manual** (a psychometric profile of your ethics).
